Que 1 )How will you tackle the challenge above? 

1. First, we read the CSV file and remember what's in each cell.
2.  Then, we look at each formula and figure out its value, considering if it needs other cell values.
3.  We check if there are any mistakes in the formulas or if they confusingly refer to each other.
4. : Finally, we write down the results in a new CSV file.


Que 2) What type of errors you would you check for? 

1. We make sure the formulas are written correctly and don't have any mistakes.

2. We check if one formula refers back to another, which can cause problems like circular dependency.

3. We double-check if formulas point to existing cells and make sense.

4. We watch out for situations where dividing by zero could cause trouble.


Que 3) How might a user break your code?

1. If the CSV file doesn't look right, like missing commas or weird cell references, it might confuse the program.

2. If someone writes a formula that's all messed up or refers back to itself in a loop, it could mess things up.

3. Some fancy stuff might not work, so if people try using it, things could go wrong.

4. If the file is too big or has lots of complicated formulas, it might slow things down or use up too much memory.
